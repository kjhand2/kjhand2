small
=====

My friend handed me this binary a few days ago, and told me that the password is
3 characters long. I haven't been able to guess it though, as it keeps crashing
on me. A rather strange binary, and pretty small to boot, too! Can you help me
with this?

P.S.  The flag (i.e. the answer) will be in the form `flag{xxxx}`.
